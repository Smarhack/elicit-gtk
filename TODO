Things left to do (unprioritized):
  
  * "Color sliders" (slider w. gradient in trough) instead of spinboxes
  * Related colors (complement / triads / etc)
    - dropdown list?
  * Ability to save magnified images?
  * Configure columns of palette view?

  * Add about page with instructions on usage

  * Averaged color selection over configurable radius
