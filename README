Elicit (gtk)
============

Elicit is a designers tool that allows one to magnify sections of the screen and select colors from any application, and organize those colors into palettes.

Dependencies
------------

Elicit is written in python for the gtk toolkit. As such, it requires:

python 2.6 
pygtk  2.16
pygobject 2.18
numpy 1.3

Earlier versions may work, but have not been tested.

Installation
------------

# ./setup.py install

If you want to run without installing, from the source directory run:

$ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/elicit


Usage
=====


Magnification
-------------
After running elicit, there is a large empty box at the top called the magnifier. Left click and drag on this to zoom in on the portion of the screen under the mouse.

The size of the region of screen magnified is determined by the size of the  magnifier. Increase the size of the window to obtain larger regions.

Scroll the mouse wheel over the magnifier to change the zoom level. After zooming in on the image, middle click and drag to pan around on the image.

By ctrl-clicking and dragging on the magnified image you can select a region of the image. Its size and diagonal are displayed beneath the magnifier.

Ctrl-click and release to remove the measurement box.

Check the 'Show Grid' checkbox to display the pixel grid over the magnified image.


Selecting Colors
----------------
The empty box on the middle left is a color picker. Left click and drag to select the color underneath the mouse cursor.

The Red, Green and Blue values are shown to the right of the color picker, along with the Hue, Saturation and Value and hexidecimal RGB format.

Right click on the color picker to add the current color to the palette.

Palettes
--------

Below the color picker is a section for managing palettes.

A dropdown list shows all available palettes. Typing in the textbox changes the name of the current palette.

To the right of the dropdown are two buttons for adding new palettes, or deleting ones you no longer wish to use.

Below this is the palette itself. Clicking on a color selects it, updating the color picker and the color values above.

If the palette contains more colors than fit on the screen, use the scroll wheel or middle-drag to pan.

Right click on a color to remove it from the palette.

Finally, you can edit the name of the selected color by changing it in the 'Color Name" textbox.

The palettes are stored in the GIMP palette formate (.gpl) in the 'palettes' subdirectory fo the users configuration directory (usually ~/.config/elicit/)
